Welcome to Space, an open-source social platform built on the Matrix protocol, designed to provide a user-friendly, secure, and decentralized communication experience in fully immersive 3D worlds with support for desktop and XR. This documentation will guide you through the basics of Space, helping you get started and familiarize yourself with the platform.

## What is Space?

Space is a social platform that leverages the Matrix protocol, a decentralized and open communication standard that enables secure, real-time communication. It provides an accessible interface for users to communicate and collaborate in a fully 3D environment that values privacy and data ownership.

## Key Features

- :globe_with_meridians: **3D Worlds**: Create and join public or private worlds for various purposes, such as discussions, project collaborations, or event organizations.
- :link: **Decentralized**: Space is built on Matrix, ensuring that your data is not controlled by a single entity. Instead, it is distributed across various servers, known as homeservers, promoting data ownership and security.
- :lock: **End-to-end encryption**: Communication in Space is protected by end-to-end encryption, ensuring that your messages and files can only be accessed by the intended recipients.
- :magic_wand: **User-friendly interface**: Space is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible even for users who are new to decentralized communication platforms.
- :handshake: **Interoperability**: The Matrix protocol allows for seamless communication between different platforms, making Space a versatile tool that can connect you to various other communication services.

To start using Space, you can use a guest account to try things out, or you can create an account. Visit the Space website, click on the "Login" button and follow the steps from there.

When signing up, you'll be prompted to choose a homeserver. This is the server where your account data will be stored. You can either choose the default homeserver provided by Space or select a different one from the list of available servers. You also have the option to set up your own homeserver if you prefer to have more control over your data.

### 2. Join or create worlds

After creating a world, you can invite other users to join by sending them an invitation or sharing the world's unique link. As the world creator, you have the ability to manage the world's settings, such as changing the world's name, description, or privacy settings. You can also assign roles and permissions to other users in the world, allowing them to help with moderation or other tasks.

### 4. Customize your profile
